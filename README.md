# Twitter Threading Editor

This is a simple UI written in HTML and JavaScript for the [twitter-threading](https://github.com/svpino/twitter-threading) tool by [@svpino](https://twitter.com/svpino).

You can enter your Twitter thread and download it as a yaml file in the format supported by [twitter-threading](https://github.com/svpino/twitter-threading).

The page is static so you can just clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser. Alternatively, the page is also deployed on Netlify.
